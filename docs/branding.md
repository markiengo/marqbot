# MarqBot — Final Brand Positioning & Voice Guidelines
Version: Definitive  
Audience: Marquette Undergraduates (starting with College of Business)

This is the single source of truth for how MarqBot should position itself and communicate across product UI, onboarding, landing pages, and future features.

The goal:  
Be unmistakably student-built.  
Be genuinely funny.  
Be academically reliable.  
Never be cringe.  
Never be corporate.

# 1. Core Brand Positioning

## One-Line Summary

MarqBot is your academically responsible but slightly chaotic degree-planning bestie — powered by rules, not vibes.

---

## Core Position Statement

MarqBot helps Marquette students figure out exactly what to take next using deterministic course logic, delivered in a voice that feels like a witty upperclassman who already learned the hard way.

It reduces confusion.  
It prevents prereq disasters.  
It does not guess.

---

## What MarqBot Is

- A deterministic degree planning engine
- A rules-based course recommendation system
- A requirement progress tracker
- A semester mapping tool (up to 8 semesters)
- Built by a Marquette student

---

## What MarqBot Is NOT

- Not CheckMarq
- Not DegreeWorks
- Not your official advisor
- Not an AI chatbot guessing your future
- Not motivational content

---

## Emotional Outcome

After using MarqBot, a student should feel:

- “Okay wait… that makes sense.”
- “I didn’t realize that class blocks three others.”
- “Fine. I’ll take the prereq first.”
- “I’m not spiraling anymore.”

---

# 2. Target Cultural Fit

Marquette students:

- Value community but don’t want corporate tone
- Are busy and academically pressured
- Appreciate humor when it’s real and earned
- Can detect forced slang instantly
- Want clarity fast

MarqBot must sound like:

- A peer who understands prereq pain
- Someone who has read the requirement sheet
- Someone who will call out a bad idea
- Someone who still respects you

---

# 3. Voice Principles

## 1. Clear First, Funny Second

Every line must:
1. Communicate the logic.
2. Then optionally add personality.

If humor reduces clarity, remove it.

---

## 2. Roast the System, Not the Student

Allowed:
- Light sarcasm about prereqs
- Jokes about gatekeeping courses
- Dramatic phrasing about long sequences

Not allowed:
- Mocking the user
- Implying incompetence
- Making them feel dumb

Example:

Good:
> This course is a gatekeeper. It blocks three others. Let’s handle it early.

Also good:
> This course gatekeeps three others. It enjoys chaos. Take it sooner.

Bad:
> You should’ve checked this earlier.

---

## 3. Deterministic Confidence

MarqBot must always communicate:

- Same inputs = same outputs
- No randomness
- No hallucinations
- No vibes

Example:
> Ranked by actual degree logic. Not guesswork.

---

## 4. Slightly Dramatic, Strategically

MarqBot can exaggerate mildly for humor:

- “Four-course saga.”
- “Bold choice.”
- “Ambitious.”
- “We’re not doing that.”

But never over-the-top meme chaos.

---

# 4. Tone Matrix by Context

| Context | Tone | Humor Level |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Onboarding | Friendly + curious | Light |
| Recommendations | Direct + confident | Medium |
| Prereq blocker | Calm + witty | Medium |
| Serious academic warning | Calm + factual | Low |
| Near graduation | Encouraging + grounded | Low |
| Help modal | Clear + structured | Light |
| Legal disclaimer | Strict + zero jokes | None |

---

# 5. Signature Language Bank

Use these types of phrases consistently.

## Approval / Positive States

- We love to see it.
- No blockers. You’re good.
- Clean path.
- Solid move.
- Efficient. Respect.
- Senior energy.

---

## Blockers

- Oopsie. That class is locked.
- Not happening (yet).
- You need [COURSE] first.
- Prereq missing. Let’s fix that.
- Bold choice. Unfortunately, no.
- Ambitious. Not eligible.

---

## Gatekeeping Courses

- This course blocks three others.

---

## Long Sequences

- This starts a four-course saga.
- Long chain. Start early.
- This sequence does not care about your senior-year plans.
- Future-you will thank you.

---

## Useless Electives (for now)

- This doesn’t move your degree forward yet.
- Fun, but not strategic right now.
- Respectfully… later.

---

## Summer

- Summer semester? Ambitious.
- Summer counts. Plan wisely.
- Grind responsibly.

---

# 6. Microcopy Standards

## Onboarding

- What’s your major?
- What classes have you finished?
- Let’s build your plan.
- Drop your completed courses. Don’t lie to me.

---

## Recommendation Screen

Header:
> Here’s what to take next.

Subtext:
> Ranked by actual degree logic.

When eligible:
> You can take this.

When missing prereq:
> Oopsie. That class is locked. You need [COURSE].

When standing issue:
> Requires junior standing. You’re not there yet.

When efficient:
> Two requirements. One class. We love efficiency.

---

## Degree Progress

- You’re 82% done.
- This requirement bucket is still hungry.
- Almost there. Don’t fumble now.
- Requirement left: [X].

Avoid:
- “Requirement group incomplete.”
- Institutional phrasing.

---

## Help Modal: How It Works

Structure must be:

1. Can you actually take it?
   If prereqs or offering don’t work, it’s out.

2. What does it count toward?
   Core + major before electives.

3. Is it blocking you?
   Gatekeeper courses move up.

4. How long is the chain?
   Long sequences start earlier.

5. Does it knock out multiple requirements?
   Two-for-one courses rank higher.

Close with:
> I assume you pass everything. Keep your courses updated so I don’t accidentally plan your downfall.

---

# 7. Hard Boundaries

These must always remain serious:

- Planning tool — not official advising.
- Always double-check with your advisor.
- Deterministic engine. No randomness.
- Final enrollment decisions go through official systems.

No jokes in disclaimers.

---

# 8. Writing Constraints

Always:

- Use short sentences.
- Prefer active voice.
- Use “you.”
- Keep paragraphs tight.
- Prioritize scannability.

Never:

- Use corporate buzzwords.
- Use excessive slang.
- Overuse “bestie.”
- Use emojis.
- Sound like a startup pitch deck.

---

# 9. Homepage Positioning Framework

Hero Headline:
Stop spiraling. Start planning.

Subheadline:
MarqBot tells you what to take next — based on what you’ve actually completed. No logins. No spreadsheets. No guessing.

CTA:
Get My Plan

Support Line:
Built by a Marquette student. Powered by real degree rules.

---

# 10. Final Brand Definition

MarqBot is:

- Smart
- Slightly dramatic
- Deterministic
- Protective of your graduation timeline
- Honest about what it is
- Funny in a dry, campus-aware way
- Academically serious under the hood

If a line of copy sounds like:
- A corporate advisor → rewrite.
- A meme page → tone it down.
- A real upperclassman who cares → keep it.
