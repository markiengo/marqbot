## Architecture Overview

MarqBot is a full-stack degree planning application. The backend is a Python/Flask API that loads CSV-backed course and program data, runs a deterministic recommendation engine, and serves a statically exported Next.js frontend.

```
Browser → Next.js static export (frontend/out/) → Flask API routes → Engine pipeline
                                                                      ↓
                                                              CSV data (data/)
                                                              Config (config/)
```

Production is deployed on Render. The Flask server serves the static frontend export and handles all API requests. There is no database — all state comes from CSVs, config JSON, and the request payload.

## Backend (`backend/`)

### Module Map

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|---------------|
| `server.py` | Flask app, all API routes, request validation, program validation (COBA_05/06), feedback storage, static frontend serving |
| `data_loader.py` | CSV loading, hard/soft prereq overlay, equivalency map construction, dynamic elective synthesis, runtime index building |
| `allocator.py` | Assigns completed and in-progress courses to buckets. Handles precedence (non-elective > elective), overflow spill to elective pools, deterministic tie-breaking |
| `eligibility.py` | Filters candidates by hard prereqs, standing gates, student stage (undergrad range), bucket min_level, college/major restrictions, concurrent compatibility. Surfaces `manual_review` for unparseable prereqs |
| `semester_recommender.py` | Ranks eligible candidates, runs the selection loop, applies credit-load warnings (CRED_01/02/04/10), handles multi-semester planning, standing recovery, bridge courses |
| `scheduling_styles.py` | Three-pass selection loop with style-specific slot reservations (grinder/explorer/mixer). Enforces WRIT limit, bucket capacity, maturity guard, bridge deferral |
| `requirements.py` | Domain constants, bucket ordering, double-count families, NDC groups, pairwise overlap policy, bucket helpers shared by allocator and eligibility |
| `prereq_parser.py` | Recursive-descent parser for hard prerequisite expressions. Supports AND/OR trees with course codes |
| `student_stage.py` | Filters course levels by student stage: undergrad (1000–4999), graduate (5000–7999), doctoral (8000+) |
| `unlocks.py` | Computes prereq chain depth for every course. Used by ranking to prioritize courses that unlock deeper chains |
| `normalizer.py` | Normalizes course codes (spacing, casing) for consistent matching |
| `validators.py` | Input validation helpers for API request payloads |

### API Routes

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `/recommend` | POST | Main recommendation endpoint. Accepts program selection, completed/in-progress courses, semester parameters. Returns multi-semester plan with progress, projection, warnings, and optional debug trace |
| `/can-take` | POST | Single-course eligibility check. Returns eligibility status, warnings, and bucket context |
| `/api/programs` | GET | Program metadata: majors, tracks, minors, bucket labels |
| `/api/courses` | GET | Full course catalog |
| `/api/program-buckets` | GET | Bucket tree for a set of program IDs. Static CSV read only — no engine |
| `/api/validate-prereqs` | POST | Detects contradictions in completed/in-progress prereq state |
| `/api/feedback` | POST | Accepts planner ratings and bug/idea reports with planner context |

### Engine Pipeline

1. **Validate** — program selection, major/track pairing, COBA_06 (max 3 business majors), COBA_05 (business minor warning).
2. **Allocate** — assign completed/in-progress courses to child buckets. Non-elective precedence. Overflow spill to elective pools.
3. **Filter** — build eligible candidates: prereqs, standing, stage, min_level, restrictions, concurrent compatibility. Surface `manual_review` for unparseable cases.
4. **Suppress** — remove non-recommendable courses (internships, independent study, topics, work periods, honors for non-honors students, fractional credits).
5. **Rank** — deterministic sort by `(tier, bridge_status, chain_depth desc, multi_bucket_score desc, course_level, course_code)`.
6. **Select** — three-pass loop (mandatory bridge, style reservations, greedy fill) with bucket caps, program balance, freshman maturity guard, concurrent follow-up, rescue pass.
7. **Warn** — attach per-semester credit-load warnings (CRED_01/02/04/10).
8. **Return** — recommendations, progress, projection, warnings, semester_warnings, debug trace.

### Priority Tiers

| Tier | Covers | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | MCC Foundation | Gates everything else |
| 2 | Business Core (BCC) | Shared prereqs for all major courses |
| 3 | Major requirements | Direct degree requirements |
| 4 | Track / Minor | Supplementary program requirements |
| 5 | MCC Late (writing, culminating) | Upper-division, deferred until credit maturity |
| 6 | Discovery themes | Wide pools, most flexibility |

### Prerequisite System

**Hard** (`course_hard_prereqs.csv`): parseable course-to-course edges (`hard_prereq`), concurrent companions (`concurrent_with`), standing gates (`min_standing`).

**Soft** (`course_soft_prereqs.csv`): machine tags (`soft_prereq`), raw catalog snippets (`soft_prereq_*`), full bulletin line (`catalog_prereq_raw`), notes. Used for warnings and manual review.

**Restriction enforcement**: `major_restriction` and `college_restriction` are enforced when machine-parseable. Currently supports 7 college names and business-major patterns. Ambiguous restrictions stay as warnings.

**Concurrent nuance**: `which may be taken concurrently` → both `hard_prereq` and `concurrent_with`. Pure co-req phrasing (`taken concurrently with`, `must be taken concurrent with`) → `concurrent_with` only.

**Manual review**: unparseable prereqs get `hard_prereq=none`, `complex_hard_prereq` soft tag, surfaced as `manual_review`.

### Bucket System

- `parent_bucket` = program envelope (major, minor, track, universal)
- `child_bucket` = individual requirement inside a parent
- `master_bucket_courses` = explicit course-to-child membership
- Requirement modes: `required`, `choose_n`, `credits_pool`
- Progress allocated at child level, rolled up to parent
- Non-elective buckets always beat elective pools in allocation and display
- Overflow spill: extra courses in full non-elective slots can count in eligible elective pools
- Dynamic elective synthesis: `elective_pool_tag` on courses → auto-mapped into `credits_pool` buckets at load time (current tag: `biz_elective`)

### Policy Enforcement

**Runtime-enforced:**
- `CRED_01` — below 12-credit full-time warning
- `CRED_02` — above 18-credit normal load warning
- `CRED_04` — CoBA 19-credit max, overload form required
- `CRED_10` — summer 16-credit cap
- `COBA_05` — CoBA students cannot declare a business minor (warning)
- `COBA_06` — max 3 business majors (hard block)
- `DC_01–DC_03` — double-count family denial, NDC group blocking, pairwise overlap
- `RT_01–RT_08` — bucket caps, overflow, tier ordering, deferral, overrides, recommendation/semester limits, summer confidence filter
- `MCC_01` — 5000+ courses excluded from MCC buckets
- Standing, stage, and restriction policies via eligibility pipeline

**Deferred:** policies requiring grade data, transfer records, advisor overrides, or GPA thresholds. Documented in `data/policies.csv` with `implementation_status = deferred`. Bucket mappings in `data/policies_buckets.csv`.

### Debug Trace

When `debug=true`, each ranked candidate includes: `rank`, `course_code`, `course_name`, `selected`, `skip_reason`, `tier`, `is_bridge_course`, `course_level`, `chain_depth`, `multi_bucket_score`, `fills_buckets`, `selection_buckets`, `current_unmet_buckets`, `bridge_target_buckets`, `bucket_capacity`.

| `README.md` | Infrastructure layout and deployment notes |

Root-level integration files: `render.yaml` (Render Blueprint), `.dockerignore`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`.

Production deployment: Render. Flask serves the static Next.js export from `frontend/out/` and handles API requests. Feedback stored at `FEEDBACK_PATH` (persistent disk in production, local file in dev).

---

## Invariants

- Deterministic ordering for identical inputs — same programs + same courses = same plan.
- No recommendation for completed or in-progress courses.
- No note-only or co-req-only codes leak into the hard prerequisite graph.
- `manual_review` surfaced explicitly in output.
- Non-elective buckets always take precedence over elective pools.
- All 76 policies documented; 22 runtime-enforced, remainder deferred with clear status.
