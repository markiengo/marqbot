dimension,standing,freshman,progress,2,"You're on the map now."
dimension,standing,freshman,progress,1,"Day one. The syllabus doesn't know your name yet."

dimension,standing,freshman,progress,2,"Every senior started exactly here. They just won't admit it."
dimension,standing,freshman,progress,1,"Orientation is over. The prereq chains are real now."
dimension,standing,freshman,progress,2,"Fresh start. No bad decisions on the record. Yet."
dimension,standing,freshman,progress,0.5,"You don't know what you don't know yet. The prereqs do."
dimension,standing,sophomore,progress,2,"Sophomore year. You know enough to be strategic."
dimension,standing,sophomore,progress,2,"No longer the new kid."
dimension,standing,sophomore,progress,1,"Second year. The training wheels are off. The prereqs noticed."
dimension,standing,sophomore,progress,2,"Survived a year. Now the real courses start."
dimension,standing,sophomore,progress,1,"Sophomore standing. You know just enough to be dangerous."
dimension,standing,sophomore,progress,2,"One year down. You've figured out the system. Mostly."
dimension,standing,sophomore,progress,2,"You've done this before. The transcript remembers."
dimension,standing,sophomore,progress,1,"Year two. The honeymoon phase is over."
dimension,standing,sophomore,progress,2,"Still early. But no longer clueless."

dimension,standing,junior,progress,0.5,"The serious courses are ahead. They know you're coming."
dimension,standing,junior,progress,2,"Junior standing unlocks the hard stuff. Congrats, I think."

dimension,standing,senior,progress,1,"Senior year. The finish line exists and it's judging you."
dimension,standing,senior,progress,2,"Four years of prereq chains led here. The chains remember."
dimension,standing,senior,progress,0.5,"Almost time to use that degree. Allegedly."
dimension,standing,senior,progress,1,"Senior standing. The part where you don't get experimental."
dimension,standing,senior,progress,2,"The last lap. Don't trip."
dimension,standing,senior,progress,1,"You've outlasted the prereq system. It's not happy about it."
dimension,standing,senior,progress,2,"Senior energy. Calm. Calculated. Slightly terrified."
dimension,standing,senior,progress,2,"The end is real. Do not sabotage it with a random elective."
dimension,standing,senior,progress,1,"One more push. This is not the time for character growth."
dimension,standing,senior,progress,2,"You've earned this standing. The transcript has receipts."
dimension,progress,early,progress,2,"Lots of road ahead. Good thing you started mapping it."
dimension,progress,early,progress,2,"Early days. The plan is forming."
dimension,progress,early,progress,0.5,"Long journey. Blink and it's junior year. Don't blink."
dimension,progress,early,progress,2,"Under 15% done. That's just the opening credits."
dimension,progress,early,progress,2,"The foundation phase. Skip it and future-you will be furious."
dimension,progress,early,progress,1,"Starting from the beginning. The prereq system doesn't do shortcuts."
dimension,progress,early,progress,2,"Every credit counts. The graduation counter is always watching."
dimension,progress,early,progress,1,"The degree is a project. You just opened the blueprint."
dimension,progress,early,progress,2,"Progress starts slow. Then it doesn't. Then it's finals."
dimension,progress,early,progress,1,"You're building the base layer. Don't skip the boring parts."
dimension,progress,early,progress,0.5,"Chapter one. It's all setup. The plot twist is junior year."

dimension,progress,building,progress,1,"Every completed course unlocks the next problem."
dimension,progress,building,progress,2,"The trajectory is up. Keep it that way."
dimension,progress,building,progress,1,"Past the slow start. Into the 'it actually counts' zone."
dimension,progress,building,progress,2,"Credits accumulating. The degree is assembling itself."
dimension,progress,building,progress,0.5,"This is what forward motion looks like. Messy but real."
dimension,progress,building,progress,2,"The degree doesn't build itself. But you're doing it."
dimension,progress,building,progress,1,"Piece by piece. Prereq by prereq."
dimension,progress,midway,progress,2,"Halfway there. The back half moves faster."
dimension,progress,midway,progress,2,"The midpoint. You can see both sides now."
dimension,progress,midway,progress,1,"50% territory. The point of no return was a while ago."
dimension,progress,midway,progress,2,"Past the halfway mark. Quitting now would be embarrassing."
dimension,progress,midway,progress,2,"The second half starts now. It moves faster. Brace."
dimension,progress,midway,progress,0.5,"You're in the middle of the story. The plot twist is coming."
dimension,progress,midway,progress,2,"Half the degree is behind you. The other half is staring."
dimension,progress,midway,progress,1,"The hardest part might already be done. Might."
dimension,progress,midway,progress,2,"Midway through. No prereq disasters yet. Suspicious."
dimension,progress,midway,progress,1,"More completed than remaining. That's a flex."
dimension,progress,midway,progress,2,"The downhill slope starts here. Gravity helps."
dimension,progress,midway,progress,0.5,"Halfway is further than most people plan for. You're here."
dimension,progress,homestretch,progress,2,"Home stretch. Can you feel it?"
dimension,progress,homestretch,progress,2,"The finish line is real. You can see it."
dimension,progress,homestretch,progress,1,"Most of the work is done. Do not get creative now."
dimension,progress,homestretch,progress,2,"You're in the final chapters. No plot twists please."
dimension,progress,homestretch,progress,2,"The remaining credits are countable. That used to be impossible."
dimension,progress,homestretch,progress,0.5,"Almost there. This is not the time to explore basket weaving."
dimension,progress,homestretch,progress,2,"The light at the end is not a train. Probably."
dimension,progress,homestretch,progress,1,"Home stretch. The finish line has your name on it."
dimension,progress,homestretch,progress,2,"Closing in. Don't let a random elective delay graduation."
dimension,progress,homestretch,progress,1,"A few more semesters. That's it. Don't make it weird."
dimension,progress,homestretch,progress,2,"You've passed the tipping point. Gravity does the rest."

dimension,progress,nearDone,both,2,"This close to done. The margin for error is gone."
dimension,progress,nearDone,both,1,"A few credits away. Future-you is watching."
dimension,progress,nearDone,both,2,"Single-digit requirements. This is the endgame."
dimension,progress,nearDone,both,0.5,"Almost. The finish line is not going to come to you."
dimension,progress,nearDone,both,2,"The hard part is behind you. Don't create new hard parts."
dimension,progress,nearDone,both,0.5,"One elective stands between you and graduation. Choose wisely."

dimension,remaining,mountain,progress,2,"Many credits ahead. At least you're looking at the number."
dimension,remaining,mountain,progress,1,"A big number. But a known number. Denial is worse."
dimension,remaining,mountain,progress,2,"The full picture. Scary? Sure. But at least it's honest."
dimension,remaining,mountain,progress,1,"Better to see the real count than pretend it's smaller."
dimension,remaining,mountain,progress,2,"Visibility beats vibes. This is the real number."
dimension,remaining,mountain,progress,1,"At least you know what you're working with."
dimension,remaining,mountain,progress,2,"The full scope. Now you can plan around it."

dimension,remaining,handful,progress,0.5,"You could list everything remaining from memory. Probably."
dimension,remaining,handful,progress,2,"The final stretch. One wrong elective and this gets awkward."
dimension,remaining,handful,progress,1,"Barely anything left. This is not the time to experiment."
dimension,remaining,handful,progress,2,"The remaining work is a rounding error. Don't round wrong."
